Welcome to the **Indian Sign Language Recognition Using Distributed Machine Learning** project! This repository showcases an innovative project aimed at recognizing Indian Sign Language (ISL) using deep learning techniques distributed across multiple processors for faster and more efficient training.

## üöÄ Introduction

Communication barriers for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities have always been a challenge. Indian Sign Language (ISL) is one such language that allows individuals to communicate using gestures. However, not everyone understands ISL, which creates a communication gap.

This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a **Sign Language Recognition (SLR) system** using **Distributed Machine Learning** to accelerate the training of deep learning models. The system leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and distributed computing with **TPUs** and **GPUs** to achieve high accuracy in recognizing hand gestures and translating them into English text.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

The main objective of this project is to create a robust and efficient system for recognizing Indian Sign Language (ISL) using machine learning. The specific challenges addressed include:
- **Recognition Accuracy**: Ensuring high accuracy in detecting and translating ISL gestures.
- **Training Speed**: Using distributed machine learning techniques to accelerate model training with large datasets.
- **Scalability**: Making the system scalable for real-world applications, enabling faster deployment of models in production environments.

## üî¨ Methodology

The methodology followed in this project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: The dataset used contains 1000 images per ISL letter. Data preprocessing involves skin detection, edge detection, and segmentation to isolate hand gestures from the background.
2. **Model Creation**: A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was created to classify the hand gestures. Multiple convolutional layers were used, followed by dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy and optimized with the Adam optimizer.
3. **Distributed Training**: The model is trained using distributed computing techniques:
   - **TPUs**: Tensor Processing Units were used to parallelize the model training, significantly reducing training time.
   - **GPUs**: Graphical Processing Units were also used to compare the performance with TPU-based distributed learning.

## üìä Results

The system achieved an accuracy of over **98%** across all distributed models, with significant speedups in training times when using TPUs and GPUs. The comparison of different training approaches showed that:
- **CPU-based Training**: Baseline accuracy, slowest training.
- **GPU-based Training**: Achieved a speedup of **4.63x** over the CPU model.
- **TPU-based Training**: Achieved a speedup of **11.32x** over the CPU model, making it the most efficient for distributed learning.
